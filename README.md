task 2 : 
🌈 Colourful To-Do List Web App

A simple, interactive and colourful To-Do List app built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
This app allows users to add, mark complete, delete, filter tasks (All / Active / Completed), and clear all.
Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.

🖥️ Tools Used

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling (gradient, animations, responsive design)

JavaScript (Vanilla) – DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage



---

🔎 How It Works (Step by Step)

1. User enters a task in the input box and clicks Add (+) or presses Enter

A new task object {id, text, done} is created

Task is stored in localStorage and shown on screen



2. Task Rendering

JavaScript dynamically creates <li> items for each task

Completed tasks are shown with a strike-through style



3. Mark Task Complete

When checkbox is clicked, the done property toggles

Task appearance updates instantly (line-through style)

State is saved in localStorage



4. Delete Task

Clicking ❌ removes the selected task from the array

UI refreshes without page reload



5. Filter Tasks

Buttons (All / Active / Completed) update what is displayed

Logic filters tasks before rendering



6. Clear All

Clicking “Clear All” empties the entire task list

localStorage is reset
